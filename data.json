D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML. D3 combines powerful visualization and interaction techniques with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation, giving you the full capabilities of modern browsers and the freedom to design the right visual interface for your data.\n\n## Resources\n\n* [API Reference](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md)\n* [Release Notes](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases)\n* [Gallery](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery)\n* [Examples](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock)\n* [Wiki](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki)\n\n## Installing\n\nIf you use npm, `npm install d3`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/latest). The released bundle supports anonymous AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments. You can load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/d3), or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/d3/). For example:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js\"></script>\n```\n\nFor the minified version:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nYou can also use the standalone D3 microlibraries. For example, [d3-selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://d3js.org/d3-selection.v1.js\"></script>\n```\n\nD3 is written using [ES2015 modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html). Create a [custom bundle using Rollup](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/bb09af4c39c79cffcde4), Webpack, or your preferred bundler. To import D3 into an ES2015 application, either import specific symbols from specific D3 modules:\n\n```js\nimport {scaleLinear} from \"d3-scale\";\n```\n\nOr import everything into a namespace (here, `d3`):\n\n```js\nimport * as d3 from \"d3\";\n```\n\nIn Node:\n\n```js\nvar d3 = require(\"d3\");\n```\n\nYou can also require individual modules and combine them into a `d3` object using [Object.assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign):\n\n```js\nvar d3 = Object.assign({}, require(\"d3-format\"), require(\"d3-geo\"), require(\"d3-geo-projection\"));\n```"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2017-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2017-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":25404},{"from":"2017-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2017-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":129681},{"from":"2016-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2017-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":445644},{"from":"2016-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2017-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":1464132},{"from":"2016-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2017-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":2697285},{"from":"2016-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2017-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":4932199}],"dependentsCount":1001,"starsCount":110},"github":{"homepage":"https://d3js.org","starsCount":58956,"forksCount":15731,"subscribersCount":2909,"issues":{"count":2904,"openCount":0,"distribution":{"3600":598,"10800":256,"32400":287,"97200":251,"291600":219,"874800":296,"2624400":264,"7873200":216,"23619600":191,"70858800":197,"212576400":129},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"mbostock","commitsCount":2260},{"username":"jasondavies","commitsCount":755},{"username":"kitmonisit","commitsCount":50},{"username":"DanGoldbach","commitsCount":24},{"username":"yasirs","commitsCount":11},{"username":"larskotthoff","commitsCount":11},{"username":"natevw","commitsCount":11},{"username":"fanktom","commitsCount":9},{"username":"square-build-bot","commitsCount":8},{"username":"scottcheng","commitsCount":8},{"username":"leodutra","commitsCount":8},{"username":"jheer","commitsCount":7},{"username":"webmonarch","commitsCount":7},{"username":"mrcarlosrendon","commitsCount":7},{"username":"NelsonMinar","commitsCount":6},{"username":"trevnorris","commitsCount":6},{"username":"hlvoorhees","commitsCount":6},{"username":"pjjw","commitsCount":5},{"username":"maoe","commitsCount":4},{"username":"snoble","commitsCount":4},{"username":"jfirebaugh","commitsCount":4},{"username":"dandv","commitsCount":4},{"username":"splendido","commitsCount":4},{"username":"mrblueblue","commitsCount":4},{"username":"GerHobbelt","commitsCount":3},{"username":"iterion","commitsCount":3},{"username":"jisaacks","commitsCount":3},{"username":"notlion","commitsCount":3},{"username":"trinary","commitsCount":3},{"username":"kmindi","commitsCount":3},{"username":"tbranyen","commitsCount":3},{"username":"dwt","commitsCount":3},{"username":"curran","commitsCount":3},{"username":"biovisualize","commitsCount":2},{"username":"Caged","commitsCount":2},{"username":"xaviershay","commitsCount":2},{"username":"johan","commitsCount":2},{"username":"asuth","commitsCount":2},{"username":"indec","commitsCount":2},{"username":"zenmoto","commitsCount":2},{"username":"jonseymour","commitsCount":2},{"username":"mmeisel","commitsCount":2},{"username":"ZJONSSON","commitsCount":2},{"username":"deanmalmgren","commitsCount":2},{"username":"clkao","commitsCount":2},{"username":"jaredly","commitsCount":2},{"username":"adnan-wahab","commitsCount":2},{"username":"guybedford","commitsCount":2},{"username":"stuglaser","commitsCount":2},{"username":"timmywil","commitsCount":2},{"username":"serhalp","commitsCount":2},{"username":"davelandry","commitsCount":2},{"username":"pelson","commitsCount":2},{"username":"dorotka","commitsCount":2},{"username":"arjenvanoostrum","commitsCount":2},{"username":"wilg","commitsCount":2},{"username":"e-","commitsCount":2},{"username":"cvrebert","commitsCount":2},{"username":"vanshady","commitsCount":2},{"username":"askmike","commitsCount":2},{"username":"lynaghk","commitsCount":1},{"username":"vtstarin","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jmalonzo","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ignacioola","commitsCount":1},{"username":"tmont","commitsCount":1},{"username":"GerardHundman","commitsCount":1},{"username":"andycjw","commitsCount":1},{"username":"radford","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ZeeDev","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mjackson","commitsCount":1},{"username":"stepheneb","commitsCount":1},{"username":"alexstrat","commitsCount":1},{"username":"geowa4","commitsCount":1},{"username":"bdon","commitsCount":1},{"username":"krid","commitsCount":1},{"username":"isaacs","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ilyabo","commitsCount":1},{"username":"theoreticaLee","commitsCount":1},{"username":"tillberg","commitsCount":1},{"username":"danmilon","commitsCount":1},{"username":"shilad","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Freeyorp","commitsCount":1},{"username":"zerolinux5","commitsCount":1},{"username":"gdi2290","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Alex--wu","commitsCount":1},{"username":"fabriciotav","commitsCount":1},{"username":"rogerbramon","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jimkang","commitsCount":1},{"username":"voidstardb","commitsCount":1},{"username":"PrajitR","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mserinjane","commitsCount":1},{"username":"afc163","commitsCount":1},{"username":"foolip","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jose-romeu","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Y--","commitsCount":1},{"username":"rbu","commitsCount":1},{"username":"alon","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mgold","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mauromelis","commitsCount":1},{"u
